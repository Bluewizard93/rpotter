# Raspberry Potter
Use a wand to control the IoT (Internet of Things)

You'll need:
- Raspberry Pi
- NoIR Camera
- IR LED Array
- Python
- OpenCV
- Some sort of IR reflective wand (like the wands you get at Universal Studios)
- Things you want to control

Be sure to watch this repo for more info!  Feedback and help appreciated!  I'll be posting with updates including how to make your own IR reflective wands.
